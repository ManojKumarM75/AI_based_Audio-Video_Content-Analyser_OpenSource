This project generates synthetic macroblocking artifacts in video frames, simulating real-world decoding errors. The generated artifacts can be used for training and testing models that detect these errors in the pipelines.

### Progress
- Completed logic in main.py
- Added support for random seed for reproducability, can be changed in configurations.py
- Added requirements.txt
- Tested the code with a sample video.


### Pending tasks
- Write proper readme
- Add code documentation file
