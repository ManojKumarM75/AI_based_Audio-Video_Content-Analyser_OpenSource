This project generates synthetic macroblocking artifacts in video frames, simulating real-world decoding errors. The generated artifacts can be used for training and testing models that detect these errors in the pipelines.

### Pending tasks
- Write proper readme
- Complete logic in main.py
- Add requirements.txt
- Add random seed for reproducability
- Add code documentation file
