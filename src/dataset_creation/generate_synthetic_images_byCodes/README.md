This project generates synthetic macroblocking artifacts in video frames, simulating real-world encoding errors. The generated artifacts can be used for training and testing models that detect and correct these errors in video processing pipelines.

### Pending tasks
- Write proper readme
- Complete logic in main.py
- Add requirements.txt
- Add random seed for reproducability
