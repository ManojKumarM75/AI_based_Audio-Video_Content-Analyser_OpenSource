MKM - MB detection 
On Sep 25th 2024, 1st time tried Tensor Flow.
On 3rd oct 2024, started working on pytorch for macro block detection. 

On my peersonal laptop, Used AI tools like SourceGraph cody, to generate the CNN model and training codes. 
As data was available at office, trained it on office data utilizing office resources. As we have NDA at office, cannot disclose any further information. 

Suggest my peermates to try these codes or better ones and lets discuss further.
